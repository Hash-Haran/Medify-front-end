**Weather App üå¶Ô∏è**
   This is a simple Weather App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to enter a city name and fetch real-time weather data for that location. The weather data is retrieved from the OpenWeatherMap API and displayed on the webpage. The app also features basic error handling to inform the user if the city name is invalid or missing.

**Features:**
1) City Search: Enter a city name and retrieve the current weather data for that city.

2) Weather Information: Display the weather description (e.g., sunny, rainy), temperature (in Celsius), and humidity.

3) Error Handling: If the city name is invalid or no input is provided, an error message will be shown.

4) Stylish Design: The app has a modern design with a 3D box shadow effect for the weather display and a background animation.

**Technologies Used:**
1) HTML: Structure of the webpage and elements.

2) CSS: Styling the layout, including animations and responsive design.

3) JavaScript: Fetching data from the OpenWeatherMap API and dynamically updating the page with weather information.

4) OpenWeatherMap API: A third-party API that provides real-time weather data based on the city name entered by the user.

**How It Works:**
1) User Input: The user enters a city name into the input field and clicks the "Get Weather" button.

2) API Request: The app makes an API request to OpenWeatherMap with the city name and retrieves the weather data.

3) Display Data: The app displays the weather description, temperature, and humidity for the specified city.

4) Error Handling: If the city is not found, an error message is displayed.

**API Key:**
You can get your own API key for OpenWeatherMap by signing up at OpenWeatherMap. Replace the placeholder API key in the script.js file with your own key.
